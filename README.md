Note-taking web app built with Go, HTMX, Supabase

## Dependencies

### Frontend

I recommend using **pnpm** as the package manager instead of yarn or npm.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Server

The Go backend so far doesn't require any dependencies, but just in case you can run `go install` to install everything required.
